# IOT-HOME-AUTOMATION-USING-THREE-TIER-ARCHITECTURE

## Objectives 

•	Develop a home automation system using three tier architecture.
 
•	Use different inner and outer network technologies.

•	Providing easy access to non techinical commoners and physically disabled people.

•	Encouraging standardization.

•	Compatible for future add-ons.

## Working

connect all the devices that we want to access virtually in the home via our phone or some other device or with our voice assistance etc.
Here we use the three-tier architecture where everything is done in three layers. These layers are connected virtually in cisco packet tracer software tool which is used to connect network devices and get the output from there whether our message is been delivered to the end device which we want to control and then we open visual studio and simulate java code where the output is accessed by the cisco packet tracer to observe whether our devices are connected.


This is developed as 6th semester mini project.
